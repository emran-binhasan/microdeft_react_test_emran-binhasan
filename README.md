# Microdeft React Internship Test

I have used Raw/Vanila CSS for most of the part.Even though i have experience with Framer-motion, GSAP and other advanced animation frameworks i didn't get to implement any.I have mastery over tailwind.Its been a long time since i last used RAW CSS for a project, thats why took me 4 Hours to finish the little task as using AI was forbidden.

While using label ,I have used 'HtmlFor' instead 'for' because react has build in 'for' that could make conflict.

Here is my auth Info :

gmail : emranbinhasan.dev@gmail.com
pass : 12345678
